## Description

A simple chatroom application built using React, ASP.NET, and SignalR.

## How to Run

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the root folder.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
   This will start the client and server using Docker Compose.

### Running Client and Server Separately

#### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
   This will start the React development server for the client.

#### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet start
    ```
   This will start the ASP.NET server for the chatroom.

## Note

Ensure that you have Docker installed for the recommended method or Node.js and .NET for running client and server separately.
